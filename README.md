## **Best Practices**
To ensure efficient and safe use of the shell scripts in this folder, follow these best practices:

1. **Understand the Script**:
   - Before running a script, read the inline comments or documentation provided in the script header.
   - Understand what the script does to avoid unintended consequences.

2. **Test in a Non-Production Environment**:
   - Always test the script in a safe or staging environment before using it in production.
   - Validate its behavior under different conditions.

3. **Back Up Data**:
   - If the script modifies files or settings, ensure you have a backup of critical data.

4. **Keep Dependencies Updated**:
   - Ensure that required tools (e.g., `aws` CLI, `bash`, `awk`) are installed and up-to-date.

5. **Log Outputs**:
   - Redirect script output to a log file for troubleshooting and auditing:
     ```bash
     ./script_name.sh > script_output.log 2>&1
     ```

6. **Version Control**:
   - Track changes to your scripts using version control (e.g., Git) to maintain history and enable rollback if needed.

7. **Secure Sensitive Data**:
   - Avoid hardcoding sensitive data like passwords or access keys into the scripts. Use environment variables or secure vaults instead.

8. **Keep Scripts Modular**:
   - Modify or extend the scripts in a modular way to make maintenance easier.

9. **Set Proper Permissions**:
   - Ensure the scripts have executable permissions:
     ```bash
     chmod +x script_name.sh
     ```
   - Avoid running scripts as `root` unless absolutely necessary.

10. **Document Changes**:
    - Document any modifications or customizations to the scripts to help future users understand your changes.
